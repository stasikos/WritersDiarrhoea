This is a clone of Write Attack (http://code.google.com/p/write-attack/).

It was created because of:
1. Write Attack is open-source, it is a Qt app, but it has no Linux builds.
2. It does not work good under wine.
3. Looks like no one is developing it.
4. I want to improve my Java GUI experience.

Source code is supposed to be built with NetBeans & Oracle JRE 6, but you can
also use Ant. It does not require any additional libs.
