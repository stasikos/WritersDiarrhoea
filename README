This is a clone of Write Attack application (http://code.google.com/p/write-attack/).
It is created because of:
1. Write Attack is open-source, it is Qt App, but it is has no builds for Linux.
2. It not works good under wine.
3. Looks like no one develops it.
4. I want to improve my Java GUI experience.


Source code is supposed to be built with NetBeans & Oracle JRE 6, but you also can use Ant.
It not requires any additional libs.
